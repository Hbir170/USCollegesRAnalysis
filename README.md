In this project, we analyze a dataset filled with information regarding many US Colleges. We clean the data where necessary, scan for any missing information, validate the data, and identify key variables to focus on such as Graduation Rates vs Size of College as well as factoring in extra variables such as Public vs Private Colleges. To finalize, we use statistical analysis as well as visualizations to help illustrate our findings.
